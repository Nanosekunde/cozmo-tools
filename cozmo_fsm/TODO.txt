Remove arucos from particle landmark lists if the aruco is part of a wall.
No need to maintain separate mu/sigma info for wall arucos.
Should still allow single arucos to be used as landmarks if they
are not part of a weall definition.

This will speed up the particle filter because we won't be calling
process_landmark on all the wall arucos.
